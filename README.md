# Footube
Footube is a YouTube-like application developed within a client-server environment. The client-side is implemented in Android Studio using Java, while the server-side is built with Node.js. This README provides an overview of the project and detailed instructions on how to set it up and run it.

# Running the Client-side (Android App)
Connect an Android Device or Start an Emulator:
Connect your Android device via USB, or start an Android emulator from AVD Manager in Android Studio.
# Run the App:
Click the Run button in Android Studio.
Grant Necessary Permissions:
Ensure the app has the necessary permissions to access the internet and read/write to storage.


Note that for now, the app is compatible with an emulator. If you are interested in using the app on a real phone, you need to change the "baseUrl" in the "Strings" file and the XML file "network_security_config", change it to your computer's IP.
